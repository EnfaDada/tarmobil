3D printed differential is not actually tested. I have modified it from previous Tarmo3 to work with Tarmo4 but I never actually tested it. I used this differential with Tarmo3 because Traxxas differential was not available in my country during building my Tarmo3. Now Traxxas differential is available here so for me there is no need to use 3D printed differential, but for somebody this may be helpfull.
